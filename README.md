**Description**                                                               
> Simple project achieving Face Recognition with the six original members of The Avengers. This repository includes the trained models for face detection and recognition with OpenCV. 

> This work is based on Adrian Rosebrock's code:

**Installation**
> Clone this repository and the implemented code requires OpenCV and Numpy to be installed in Python (Python 3 was used):
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libfontconfig1-dev libcairo2-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libhdf5-103 libqtgui4 libqtwebkit4 libqt4-test python3-pyqt5 python3-dev
  
  $ sudo pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
  
  $ sudo pip3 install numpy
  ```
> The model's zip file needs to be extracted and placed at the same level as output, videos and app.py:

**Execution**
> The application was designed to process an input video and outputs the processed video:
```
$ sudo python3 app.py

```

> Try the demo implemented, test other videos, and have fun!
